# Pokédex Web App

## Description

This is my first responsive web application! I am developing it with HTML, CSS and JavaScript as part of my student portfolio for CareerFoundry’s Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp.

The app fetches data from PokéAPI to display Pokémons as a list of buttons, each of which triggers a modal when clicked on to show its Pokémon's details (image, id, name, height and types).

## View

The project is not yet deployed. To run it, download the code and open the index.html file locally.
